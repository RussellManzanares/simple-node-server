    <p><font face="Arial">Young Me</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">My childhood was a pretty normal one. I played a lot of games just like the other kids. My shyness, something that I still carry with me today, was the only thing that set me apart from my peers. 
    I would say that my childhood  instilled in me virtues that helped me deal with problems and formulate solutions. From something as unassuming as a jigzaw puzzle, I learned that there's more meaning to some things than just the sum of their individual parts.
    Being born in Zamboanga City, I was able to learn different languages other than Filipino and English.<br><br><br>

        <p><font face="Arial">High-School Me</font></p>
        <p align="justify">During highschool, I started to have a liking for economics and finance, something that would endure until now.  It was also at this age that I started to have what others call a 'lovelife'. This age was also period of discovery. A lot of things that weren't taught, and my parents aren't willing to teach, I learned it myself. 
As with other teens, this was the time when I was at my most rebellious. Not in the violent sense of the word, but rather on matters of not heeding my parents' advice. Of course, when you grow up, you realize that what they're telling you was right all along.  </p>

                <p><font face="arial">College Me</font></p>
                <p align="justify"> College turned me into a different person, in more ways than one. For a <i>probinsyano</i>, going to study in Luzon and trying to live with your broken Tagalog is life-changing enough. At this point in my life, my perception of the world around me and my guiding principles had been fully ingrained. 
                The organizations I joined in also made a lasting influence on me. As a debater, what was once considered as a weakness has now become my strength. I can now effectively communicate my thoughts well. My other organization, UPLB Economics Society, gave me a second family. Knowing my batchmates was truly on of the highlights 
                of my college life. The last thing that I want to talk about is my dear University. Despite all the frustrations, ranging from hard subjects to hard to get subjects, all of these are trumped by one single fact that it has taught me: This is how the real world works.  </p>

         <p align="Justify"><font face="arial">Future Me</font></p>
         <br>
         <p align="Justify"> When I graduate, I plan to work for a financial services company. Whether it be a bank, hedge fund, or an insurance company. I plan to get my Master's Degree, and hopefully my doctorate. Moreover, I feel morally obliged to stay in my country. Even if some opportunity opens up abroad that happens to pay a higher salary, I would still stay here. </p>
