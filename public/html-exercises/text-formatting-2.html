        I attended high-school in Ateneo de Zamboanga University.
        As a college student, I am from CEM. There are a lot of books that I fancy, therefore I will just enumerate their categories: philosophy, politics, economics, and one series in particular, Harry Potter. The most memorable quote I've learned in school is a line from the poem 'Dont Quit. It says, "Rest if you must but don't you quit."
